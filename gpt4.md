   - Listening to [Mozart's Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaH3zI0bYkM), especially the sections where the solemn chord progressions like D minor to F Major 6th, E minor 7th flat 5th, and others unfold, indeed highlights a unique aspect of his compositional genius. The emotional depth and the complexity of the emergent polyphony in Mozart's work can feel unparalleled and deeply moving. 

   - Mozart and Bach, however, represent two pinnacle moments in the history of Western classical music, each within their own contexts and stylistic periods. Bach's music, situated in the Baroque era, showcases the epitome of counterpoint and complex, interwoven lines of melody. His mastery over fugues, where multiple voices interact in a strict mathematical and yet deeply expressive manner, is unrivaled. 

   - Mozart, on the other hand, flourished in the Classical period, where the emphasis shifted towards clarity, balance, and form. His Requiem, although unfinished at his death, stands as a testament to his ability to blend operatic drama with liturgical solemnity, creating an emotionally potent work that speaks to the human experience of mourning, hope, and redemption.

   - To suggest that Mozart's Requiem reaches an entirely different level than Bach's compositions might speak more to the personal resonance you feel with Mozart's music or the specific emotive quality and textural richness of the Requiem itself. Both composers, in their own ways, pushed the boundaries of music, engaging deeply with the human condition through their compositions. 

   - Bach's music, with its intricate polyphonic structures and profound spirituality, offers a different kind of depth, one that is architectural and intellectually engaging. Mozart, with his innate sense of melody, harmonic innovation, and dramatic flair, touches the heart directly, often with a more immediate emotional impact.

   - These differences highlight the beauty of classical music's evolution, showing how each era builds upon the past while innovating in its own right. Appreciating both Bach's and Mozart's contributions to music can be like enjoying different facets of a brilliantly cut gem, each reflecting light in its own unique way.
